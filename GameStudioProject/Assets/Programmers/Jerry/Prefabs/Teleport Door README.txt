----USE------

- Have a one-way teleporter for the player from one location to another

----WHAT IS IT?-----

-An empty with a box collider marked as a trigger
-The empty should be tagged "Teleport" (case sensitive) if this isn't the case the script will not work

----HOW TO USE IT?-----

-Place the prefab in your scene
-Ensure the prefab is tagged "Teleport" (case sensitve)
-Look at the attached script in the inspector and assign an object in the game world you'd like the player to be teleported to
     -This can be a real game object (in which case the player will be teleported inside the object and get stuck)
     -Or you can use an empty to create a sort of "teleport point"
-Once this point is assigned in the inspector the player should be teleported there upon entering the trigger

-If you have any issues,comments, or questions about this prefab contact Jerry Monnecka
